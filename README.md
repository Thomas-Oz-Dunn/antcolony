# antcolony
This is a repo for my experiments in running an ant colony simulation.
There is work in both MATLAB & Python so far, as I learn better ways to use the different languages.

How do I run the simulation in realtime, keeping track of the time increments, so that trails dissipate over time?
How do I keep track of the intensity of the trail if currently they are stored discretely?
